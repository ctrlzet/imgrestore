<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This repo provides the replication of paper on image restoration. The goal is to restore high-quality images from low-quality images. We utilized SwinIR [(Liang et al., 2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10257) model based on the Swin Transformer, which consisted of three main parts:
* Shallow feature extraction
* Deep feature extraction
  â€“ Composed of many residual Swin Transformer blocks (RSTB), each has several Swin Transformers layers together with a residual connection
* High-quality image reconstruction.
We examined the performance of SwinIR with its default blind noises against our own synthetic noise. Moreover, we implemented the ISTA/FISTA algorithms with SwinIR as a de-noising model for non-blind deblurring problem.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ctrlzet/imgrestore
   ```

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

Our repo follows steps mentioned in [2nd](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QSgaFGV3dygyWZ2JUkI_GHgAytU5b-sI/view) project description

- [main branch](https://github.com/ctrlzet/imgrestore/tree/main) consists of two directories correspoding to [training](https://github.com/ctrlzet/imgrestore/tree/main/training) and [inference](https://github.com/ctrlzet/imgrestore/tree/main/inference) procedures each. This is all about replication of original paper + implication of projection layer. User required to follow a step-by-step intructions mentioned in `.ipynb` files located in same path.
- The first task covering research solved [here](https://github.com/ctrlzet/imgrestore/blob/main/Research_task1.pdf).
- Finally, ISTA/FISTA algorithms stored [here](https://github.com/ctrlzet/imgrestore/tree/ISTA_implementation).
